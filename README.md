ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Darwin

I have experience in backend, with python frameworks like flask and a
bit of django, however, lately I am focusing on serverless in aws, which
allows to run functions without these web frameworks.

I have dealt with data analysis and machine learning problems, also in
python, on images and audios. I can do web data collection, through
libraries focused for that (scrapy), cleaning and use to support
business intelligence areas. I also have knowledge on decision making
algorithms to further support this area.

I have worked with the architect-technical approach to microservices in
the python language, so I can help design parts of the backend system. I
am fascinated by efficiency so I try to apply all my knowledge to create
quality products.

As for the frontend, it is not my forte, since I do not like so much the
visual design, however, I can make functionalities that are required of
me of all kinds within this by means of the React library or the Next js
framework (based on react) or React native for mobile devices. As long
as the design is established.
